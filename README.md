Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for sales prediction, identifying key drivers of sales performance and preparing data for predictive modeling.

## Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory analysis of sales data to:
- Identify patterns and trends in sales performance
- Discover relationships between sales and key business factors
- Prepare data for predictive modeling
- Generate actionable business insights

**Key Features:**
- Time series decomposition of sales trends
- Correlation analysis of sales drivers
- Seasonality and promotional impact analysis
- Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior
- Feature engineering for predictive modeling

## Technical Implementation

### Analytical Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution analysis of key variables
3. **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationship between sales and potential predictors
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Trend, seasonality, and cyclic pattern identification
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new predictive features from raw data
6. **Preliminary Modeling**: Baseline models to identify key predictors
